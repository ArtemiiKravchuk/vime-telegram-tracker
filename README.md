Track changes in public Telegram user data, like profiles, stories or online status

## Installation

Clone the repo from GitHub and install libraries:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ArtemiiKravchuk/vime-telegram-tracker.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Change `config.json` according to your needs.

You have to fill in the `telegram => api_id` and `telegram => api_hash` fields with values from https://my.telegram.org

In `targets => users` field, put a list of users to track. You can use integer id (the user should be in your contacts) or string username (the user doesn't have to be in your contacts)

Program will save all the data in the desired format. You can change this in `output` filed of config: there should be a list of all locations to ouput data to.

As an example, program will save both to sqlite database and csv files, but you can remove unncesessary location.

## Running the program

To start the program, start `main.py`.

As the program is running, it will create additional folders:
- `logs` - you can delete it whenever you like, it stores program logs, that can help fix some problems later on.
- `output` - you'll find all the data, generated by a program, there.
- `sessions` - stores `.session` files: if you delete this folder, you'll have to log in your Telegram account again; program can also work slower if you delete it.
- `temp` - it's not recommended to delete/modify this folder, it prevents data duplicates. But you can make a fresh start by removing this folder together with the `output` folder.

## Understanding output

Each module saves it's own data (profiles, stories, etc). This data is being saved in it's own files (`profile.csv`, `story.csv`) or inside SQLite tables.

There are some things you might want to know:
- Time is stored in UNIX timestamp format.
- Media is stored in specific folders in the `output` folder. You'll find path to the media files in your tables
